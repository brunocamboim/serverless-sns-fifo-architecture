This is a simple project to build a synchronized architecture to send messages in order.
I'm using the following services:

First of all, clone the repository.

1.	Installation process

# Build and Test
  - To build your application and deploy to AWS, you need to set some envs. See the docs: <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/"> https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/ </a>
